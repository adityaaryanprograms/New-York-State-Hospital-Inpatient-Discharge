# New York State Hospital Inpatient Discharge (Capstone Project in Healthcare Domain)

## Problem Statement
The healthcare sector in New York is struggling to provide equal access to healthcare for all communities across the state. Additionally, it is facing challenges in making informed decisions about treatment plans, efficient allocation of resources and discharge planning. For this, we can use data science techniques to identify which areas need more healthcare coverage for specific diagnoses or procedures along with the prediction of length of stay and risk of mortality of patients.

## Description
The large dataset consists of 21,01,588 rows and 33 columns which describe healthcare records on different types of parameters. There were a significant number of records with unknown ethnicities. Patients of such records mostly belonged to ‘Other Race’ for which the modal ethnicity was Spanish and thus they were assigned Spanish ethnicity. SMOTE was performed to balance the imbalanced risk of mortality variable without losing information. Clustering and supervised learning models were designed to analyse regional variations and recommend meaningful improvements.

## Outcome
Models were developed to explain 85% variation in LOS and predict risk of mortality with good accuracy. Clusters were formed based on top diagnoses in the data.

## Key Skills Used
Pandas, Pre-processing, Variable Analysis, Transformation, Encoding, Hypothesis Testing, Regression, Classification, Clustering, PCA, Ensemble, Boosting
